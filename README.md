# Bloom of Life
Welcome,

This website was developed to create a *Brazilian community* of new moms or pregnant women in Ireland, and was called **Bloom of Life**. The aim of the project is **connect, inspire, and share** experiences with each other. Provide shelter for those insecure mothers in a different country and away from family, and care for those who feel alone throughout the challenges of maternity.
