# Bloom Of Life

Welcome,

This website was developed to create a *Brazilian community* of new moms or pregnant women in Ireland, and was called [**Bloom Of Life**](https://cesargarciajr.github.io/bloom-of-life/#second-section). The aim of the project is *connect, inspire, and share* experiences. Provide shelter for those insecure mothers in a different country and away from family, and care for those who feel alone throughout the challenges of maternity.

  - ### Wireframes

    The wireframes for Bloom Of Life were produced in [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

  - ### Site Structure
    The site structure consists of a *"one-page"* with a *"sticky"* menu to make navigation easier through the website. There are 3 different sections such as [**Landing**](<#landing-section>), [**About Us**](<#about-us-section>), [**Our Community**](<#our-community-section>) and [**Join Us**](<#join-us-section>), also includes a [**Footer**](<#footer>) for social media and easy links to connect and get to know more about the project.

  - ### Design Choices

    - #### Typography
        - The website uses three different fonts in a consistent distribution for better experience:
            1. Send Flowers or fallback cursive (https://fonts.google.com/)

            ![Alt text](assets/images/send-flowers.png "Send Flowers font")

            2. Indie Flower or fallback cursive (https://fonts.google.com/

            ![Alt text](assets/images/indie-flower.png "indie flower font")

            3. Sans- Serif or fallback Times New Roman

    - #### Color Scheme
        - The colors were chosen to remind Brazilian flag with a variation of greens and yellow as in the image below

## Features
  Bloom Of Life site is set up to be welcoming and easy to use. It contains many features that the user would probably be familiar with, such as a navigation bar and contact form. The overall feel of the website is intended to be inviting and not intimidating to encourage the user to explore further. 
    
  ### Landing Section
  Here the user can clearly see the name of purpose of the community as well as the Nav Menu which allows the user to go a specific content related to the community. The landing page is the Hero Image of two pragnant women holding flowers matching the name of the community.

  ### About Us Section
  Here the user gets to know more about the organizer of the community and what she can offer as well as a little bit about her background and experiences. Also includes a picture of her to create some affection with the user.

  ### Join Us Section
  In this section, the user can find useful information about time, location, and also how to subscribe to the community. Also were allocated a mini Google maps for a better experience if the user needs to get direction. There is also a form so the user can subscribe for any updates and be part of the community.

  ### Future Features
  - There are a number of features that would improve the User Experience that I would like to implement in the future:
  - Have a Portuguese and English version of the website so the user can choose which language is preferable.
  - Implement some of the latest content published in some of the social media such as Instagram or Facebook so the user might feel interested and follow the social platforms as well.
  - Comments and reviews would allow users to engage with the content and provide recommendations to other users.

## Testing
- Tested in differents mobile devices and chrome web browser
- Tested using the [**CCS validador**](https://www.w3.org/)
- Tested using the [**HTML validator**](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
- Tested using the Lightroom dev tool from Google Chrome

You can see the reports below as mentioned before:

 ### Bugs and Issues

Debugging and troubleshooting were done constantly throughout development, however still two main problems with the website:

- The Sticky menu at the top of the page was designed to facilitate the navigation during the user experience however when clicking any of the sections, it crops a little bit at the top of the section


![Alt text](assets/images/cropped-top.png "cropped section")

But it was supposed to look like this:


![Alt text](assets/images/about-us-section.png "Section")

So we found a solution with Carl Murray to add the code below to "push" the content down when the nav bar is clicked in order to fit the content perfectly to the website frame

![Alt text](assets/images/fixed-bug.png "fixed-bug")


- Another bug I notice is when the website is in the mobile version the footer goes behind my content but only when mobile:

![Alt text](assets/images/footer-mobile-bug.png "Footer bug")

- The problem was the Join Us section had absolute height value of 700px so the container was overlaping the footer but then it was setted to 100% and the footer now is reponsive

## Technologies Used
I used the following technologies, platforms and support in building my project:
- Wireframes and mockups were designed in [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/#)
- The website is built with HTML and CSS only.
- The [**Code Institute**](https://codeinstitute.net/) modules/lessons aided my learning and many of the concepts learned were applied in this project.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cesargarciajr/bloom-of-life) was used for the project repository.
- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for all fonts on the site.
- [**FontAwesome**](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for the social media icons which then had additional styling applied to them.
- [**Colors CO**](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a colour pallete for this readme file.
- [**Adobe Colors**](https://color.adobe.com/pt/create/color-contrast-analyzer) and contrast was used to pick color and check if the contrast was good enough for users.
- Also had to learn how to use Flexbox which plays a important role in positioning the sections and elements in the website which I learned from [**W3 Schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp)

## Deployment

First of all you need to have a [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cesargarciajr/bloom-of-life) account, I choose [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cesargarciajr/bloom-of-life) because it's free and easy to create a repository to host your code and share with others.

- To create a repository you just need to go to the main page at the top right you will see a "+" button just click here and then new repository

- Select the name of the project and a description make it public and then create a repository

- Once you created your repository go the settings section and then click on pages

- Select the Branch as main and then save it.

- Finally, your repository is deployed and it should show you a link so you can share it with others.
